Ray Tracer program by Andrew Acosta

How to make:
to make the program, just type "make". This should result in a lot of object files and the rt executable
to make the Unit test mode, type "make UNIT=1". This should result in object files and the rt_test executable

How to run:
    Use this to create an image called sample.tga of the pov ray file
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov>" << endl;

    Using this will run the ray tracer with a width of 640 height of 480 by defualt
    rt <input_scene.pov>

Use "make clean" to remove all of the executables and object files

Current Status:
Ray Generation: Working
Sphere Collision: Working
Plane collision: Working
Shading: only showing the color of the object
