Ray Tracer program by Andrew Acosta

PART 3

How to make:
to make the program, just type "make". This should result in a lot of object files and the raytrace executable
to make the Unit test mode, type "make UNIT=1". This should result in object files and the raytrace_test executable

BRDFs to choose from:
0 = Blinn-Phong
1 = Cook-Torrence using Cook-Torrence Geometry, (Trowbridge-Reitz) Distribution, and Schlick approximation for the Fresnel
2 = An attempt at toon-shading. Still under construction. 

How to run:
    Use this to create an image called sample.tga of the pov ray file
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov> <BRDF>

    Using this will run the ray tracer with Blinn-Phong automatically picked
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov>

    Using this will run the ray tracer with a width of 640 height of 480 by defualt
    rt <input_scene.pov> <BRDF>

    Using this will run the ray tracer with Blinn-Phong and a width of 640 height of 480 by defualt
    rt <input_scene.pov>

Use "make clean" to remove all of the executables and object files

Current Status:
    Fixed naming the resulting images and exe files (apparently wasn't doing that right since part 1)
    Triangle Intersections working
    Reflections working
    Refractions working - but the pov ray version

Parsing: what is missing
        Cones
        Transforms
        
Non-working shapes:
        Cones
        Boxes
