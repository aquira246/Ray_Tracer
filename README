Ray Tracer program by Andrew Acosta

PART 5

How to make:
to make the program, just type "make". This should result in a lot of object files and the raytrace executable
to make the Unit test mode, type "make UNIT=1". This should result in object files and the raytrace_test executable

BRDFs to choose from:
0 = Blinn-Phong
1 = Cook-Torrence using Cook-Torrence Geometry, (Trowbridge-Reitz) Distribution, and Schlick approximation for the Fresnel
2 = An attempt at toon-shading. Still under construction. 

Anti-Aliasing = 0 is off, anything else is on
GlobalIllumination = 0 is off, 2 or 3 is the number of levels of recursion. It has a cap at 3.

Default values:
<width> 640
<height> 480
<BRDF> Blinn-Phong
<Anti-Aliasing> on
<Global Illumination> off

How to run:
    Use this to create an image called sample.tga of the pov ray file
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov> <BRDF> <Anti-Aliasing> <Global Illumination>
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov> <BRDF> <Anti-Aliasing>

    Use this to toggle BRDF and use Anti-Aliasing
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov> <BRDF>

    Using this will run the ray tracer with Blinn-Phong automatically picked
    rt <width> <height> <input_scene.pov>

    Using this will run the ray tracer with a width of 640 height of 480 by defualt
    rt <input_scene.pov> <BRDF>

    Using this will run the ray tracer with Blinn-Phong and a width of 640 height of 480 by defualt
    rt <input_scene.pov>

Use "make clean" to remove all of the executables and object files

Current Status:
    Global Illumination with Monte Carlo: Working, although it is noisy. And takes SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long.
    Accelerated using a BVH. An Oct-Tree is under construction for fun though I doubt it will be finished.
    Transforms: Working
    Working shapes: Boxes, Spheres, Triangles, and Planes
    Reflections: Working
    Refractions: Working and using Schlick's Approximation. Beer's law is commented out at the moment
    Shadows: Working, currently hard shadows only
    BRDFS: Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrence, and an experimental toon shading
    General sanity: hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhhhahaaaahahahahhahahaAHHAHAhAHhahAAHahahAHHAsdkfhaosjhfbwkjegfuakhsbfuekhs

Parsing: what is missing
        Cones
        
Non-working shapes:
        Cones

Extra things to do later:
    Finish Oct-Tree
    Finish Toon-Shading
    Textures
    Soft Shadows with Monte-Carlo
